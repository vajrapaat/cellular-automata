# Cellular Automata Summer School
All the scripts written as requirements for the assignments in the Indian Summer School on Cellular Automata, 2025. Of 5 assignments, 4 required a script, to which I have coded them in IPython/Jupyter notebook.

NumPy = 2.0.2<br>
Matplotlib = 3.10.0<br>
NetworkX == 3.5<br>
Pydot == 3.0.4<br>

## Installation
To clone the repository, use the following bash script
<pre lang='markdown'>git clone https://github.com/vajrapaat/cellular-automata.git 
cd cellular-automata 
pip install -r requirements.txt</pre>

To run the notebook:
1. Open `file_name.ipynb`      # change the name of the file according to the assignment
2. Run all cells in order

This notebook is Colab compatible, and can be run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
